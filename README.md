Convective Heat Transfer

This is the course content for graduate convective heat transfer in the Dept of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics at Drexel Universitiy, taught by Prof. Wes Chang starting from Winter 2024 onwards. The course covers topics including forced and natural convection, laminar and turbulent flow, momentum and energy equations for convective heat transfer, boundary layer theory. The course also implements some Python programming and COMSOL modeling, as well as review and discussion of published scientific literature in preparation for graduate-level research.
